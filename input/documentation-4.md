### File Name
ArticleFavorite.cs

### Logic
1. Define a class named `ArticleFavorite`.
2. Specify that the `ArticleFavorite` class is public.
3. Declare properties in the `ArticleFavorite` class:
   1. `ArticleId` - an integer property that is public and can be initialized.
   2. `Article` - a nullable reference to an `Article` object, which is public and can be initialized.
   3. `PersonId` - an integer property that is public and can be initialized.
   4. `Person` - a nullable reference to a `Person` object, which is public and can be initialized.

### Summary
The `ArticleFavorite.cs` file contains the definition of the `ArticleFavorite` class, which is part of the domain logic for managing the relationship between articles and users in a system, typically used to denote if a user has favorited a particular article. The class includes properties to store the identifiers of both the article (`ArticleId` and `Article`) and the person (`PersonId` and `Person`) associated with the favorite action. This design allows for tracking which articles are favored by which users within the application.
