### File Name
ServicesExtensions.cs

### Logic
1. **Function AddConduit(services)**
   - Use services to register MediatR with the current assembly.
   - Register the ValidationPipelineBehavior with transient lifetime.
   - Register DBContextTransactionPipelineBehavior with scoped lifetime.
   - Call to add FluentValidation automatic validation.
   - Add FluentValidation client-side adapters.
   - Register all validators from the current assembly.
   - Register AutoMapper using the Program type.
   - Register PasswordHasher with scoped lifetime for IPasswordHasher.
   - Register JwtTokenGenerator with scoped lifetime for IJwtTokenGenerator.
   - Register CurrentUserAccessor with scoped lifetime for ICurrentUserAccessor.
   - Register ProfileReader with scoped lifetime for IProfileReader.
   - Register HttpContextAccessor with singleton lifetime for IHttpContextAccessor.

2. **Function AddJwt(services)**
   - Use services to initialize options.
   - Create a SymmetricSecurityKey from a predefined string.
   - Create signing credentials with HMAC SHA256 algorithm using the signing key.
   - Define issuer and audience as strings.
   - Configure JwtIssuerOptions with issuer, audience, and signing credentials.
   - Set up TokenValidationParameters with validation settings:
     - Enable validation of signing key.
     - Define valid issuer.
     - Define valid audience.
     - Enable validation of token lifetime.
     - Set clock skew to zero.
   - Add authentication using JWT Bearer scheme.
   - Configure the JWT Bearer options with token validation parameters.
   - Define an event for message reception that extracts the token from the Authorization header.

3. **Function AddSerilogLogging(loggerFactory)**
   - Configure a new LoggerConfiguration with verbosity at verbose level.
   - Enrich the logging context.
   - Set up a console sink for local debugging with a specific output template.
   - Add the configured logger to the provided loggerFactory.
   - Assign the logger to the static Log.Logger.

### Summary
The `ServicesExtensions.cs` file serves as a collection of extension methods that facilitate the registration of various services and configurations within the dependency injection container of an application. It primarily focuses on integrating MediatR for handling commands and queries, setting up JWT-based authentication, and configuring logging through Serilog. The file allows for structured and centralized configuration of essential services such as validation, token generation, and HTTP context access, which are integral for building robust backend functionalities in the application architecture. This modular approach aids in managing dependencies more efficiently and supports the overall scalability and maintainability of the codebase.
