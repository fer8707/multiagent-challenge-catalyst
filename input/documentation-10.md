### File Name
ArticleEnvelope.cs

### Logic
1. Define a public class named `ArticleEnvelope`.
2. Define a property named `Article` within the `ArticleEnvelope` class that has a type of `Article`.
3. Ensure that the `Article` property can be both get and set.
4. The `ArticleEnvelope` is a data structure used to wrap an `Article` object.

### Summary
The purpose of the `ArticleEnvelope.cs` file is to define a data structure named `ArticleEnvelope`, which encapsulates an `Article` object. This is typically used in response payloads of APIs to provide a consistent format around the article data. The use of such an envelope allows for easier management and serialization of article-related information within the application’s architecture.
