### File Name
Program.cs

### Logic
1. **Configure Services**
   1. Create a new service collection instance.
   2. Add database context to the service collection using Entity Framework.
   3. Add application services required for the application.
   4. Add logging services to the service collection.

2. **Configure Request Pipeline**
   1. Create a new application builder instance.
   2. Serve static files if they are requested.
   3. Use routing capability for the application.
   4. Enable authorization and authentication middleware.
   5. Map the application endpoints for handling requests.
   6. Setup Swagger for API documentation.
   7. Run the application server.

3. **Run the Application**
   1. Build the application.
   2. Start listening for incoming requests.

### Summary
The purpose of the `Program.cs` file is to define the application's entry point and configure essential services and middleware for an ASP.NET Core web application. This includes setting up the database context interaction, registering various necessary services, and defining the middleware pipeline that governs how requests are processed. The file ensures that the application can dynamically respond to incoming HTTP requests by routing them through a predetermined set of operations and responses, while also enabling features like API documentation through Swagger. This foundational setup is crucial for the application's structure and operational capabilities.
