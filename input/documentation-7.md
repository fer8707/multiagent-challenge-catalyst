### File Name
FollowedPeople.cs

### Logic
1. Define a class named `FollowedPeople`.
2. Create a property named `ObserverId` of data type `int` with public access and initialization.
3. Create a property named `Observer` of data type `Person?` with public access and initialization.
4. Create a property named `TargetId` of data type `int` with public access and initialization.
5. Create a property named `Target` of data type `Person?` with public access and initialization.

### Summary
The purpose of the `FollowedPeople.cs` file is to define a class called `FollowedPeople` that represents a relationship between two entities in a domain model. Specifically, it tracks which person (the Observer) is following another person (the Target), identified by their respective IDs and references. The class contains properties to store identifiers and optional references to the `Person` objects for both the observer and the target. This structure is likely used to manage follower relationships within the application's domain context.
