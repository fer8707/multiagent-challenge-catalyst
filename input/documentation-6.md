### Summary
The `Comment.cs` file defines a class named `Comment`, which represents a comment in a system, likely related to articles or posts. Each instance of the class includes properties for identification and content details, such as `CommentId`, `Body`, `Author`, and related identifiers for the author and article (`AuthorId`, `ArticleId`). Additionally, it captures timestamps for when the comment was created and last updated (`CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`). The properties are designed to be publicly accessible and utilize `get` and `init` accessors, indicating that they can be set at initialization and are immutable afterwards. This structure allows easy representation and manipulation of comment data within the broader application context.
