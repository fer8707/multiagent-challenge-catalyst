### File Name
Tag.cs

### Logic
1. **Define the class**:
   - Create a public class named `Tag`.

2. **Define properties**:
   - Define a property `TagId` of type `string?` that is public and can be initialized.
   - Define another property `ArticleTags` of type `List<ArticleTag>` that is public and can be initialized.

### Summary
The purpose of the file `Tag.cs` is to define a `Tag` class within the `Conduit.Domain` module. This class includes a `TagId` property, which stores an identifier for the tag, and an `ArticleTags` property, which is a list that holds references to `ArticleTag` entities. The class encapsulates the concept of a tag in the context of an application, potentially allowing for tagging articles with specific identifiers to categorize or group them. The properties are structured to allow for flexible and safe initialization.
