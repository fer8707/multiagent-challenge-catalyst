### Logic
1. **Define the Article class as public**:  
   - The Article class represents an article in the domain model.

2. **Declare properties of the Article class**:  
   - `ArticleId` (int, public, get, init): Identifier for the article.
   - `Slug` (string?, public, get, set): A URL-friendly identifier for the article, which can be null.
   - `Title` (string?, public, get, set): Title of the article, which can be null.
   - `Description` (string?, public, get, set): Brief description of the article, which can be null.
   - `Body` (string?, public, get, set): Main content body of the article, which can be null.
   - `Author` (Person?, public, get, init): The author of the article, represented by a Person object, which can be null.
   - `Comments` (List<Comment>, public, get, init): List of comments associated with the article.
   - `Favorited` (bool, public): Indicates if the article is favorited or not.
   - `FavoritesCount` (int, public): Count of how many times the article has been favorited.
   - `TagList` (List<string>, public): List of tags associated with the article.
   - `ArticleTags` (List<ArticleTag>, public, get, init): List of ArticleTag objects associated with the article.
   - `ArticleFavorites` (List<ArticleFavorite>, public, get, init): List of ArticleFavorite objects associated with the article.
   - `CreatedAt` (DateTime, public, get, init): Date and time when the article was created.
   - `UpdatedAt` (DateTime, public, get, set): Date and time when the article was last updated.

### Summary
The `Article.cs` file defines the `Article` class within the `Conduit.Domain` module. This class models an article entity, encapsulating various properties that represent essential attributes of an article, such as its unique identifier (`ArticleId`), content (`Body`, `Title`, `Description`), metadata like `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, and features like `Favorited` status and a list of `Comments`. Additionally, it handles relationships to other entities, like the author represented by a `Person`, tags associated with the article, and maintenance of favorited articles through `ArticleFavorites`. This structure serves as a core element of the application's domain model, enabling the manipulation and management of articles.
