### File Name
ArticleTag.cs

### Logic
1. Define a class named `ArticleTag`.
2. The class has the following properties:
   - `ArticleId`: An integer representing the unique identifier for an article. It has public access and can be initialized.
   - `Article`: An optional reference to an `Article` object. It has public access and can be initialized.
   - `TagId`: An optional string representing the unique identifier for a tag. It has public access and can be initialized.
   - `Tag`: An optional reference to a `Tag` object. It has public access and can be initialized.

### Summary
The purpose of the `ArticleTag.cs` file is to define the `ArticleTag` class, which is used to establish a relationship between articles and tags in a domain-driven design. The `ArticleTag` class holds identifiers for both articles and tags, as well as references to the associated objects. This structure supports the functionality of categorizing articles using tags, which is common in content management systems or blogging platforms. The properties defined in this class allow easy access and initialization of article-tag relationships, contributing to the overall organization and retrievability of content within the application.
