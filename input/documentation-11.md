### File Name
ArticleExtensions.cs

### Logic
1. Define a public static class named `ArticleExtensions`.
2. Inside the class, define a function named `GetAllData`.
   - **Parameters**: Accept a parameter named `articles` of type `IQueryable<Article>`.
   - **Return Type**: The function returns an `IQueryable<Article>`.
3. Inside the function body:
   - Utilize the `Include` method to join data from related entities:
     1. Include the `Author` of each article.
     2. Include the `ArticleFavorites` associated with each article.
     3. Include the `ArticleTags` related to each article.
   - Apply `AsNoTracking()` to the query to improve performance by not tracking changes to the returned entities.
4. Return the modified `articles` query.

### Summary
The `ArticleExtensions.cs` file contains a class named `ArticleExtensions` that provides an extension method called `GetAllData` for the `IQueryable<Article>` type. This method enhances a query on articles by including related entities, such as authors, favorites, and tags, which are essential for retrieving comprehensive article data in a single query. The use of `AsNoTracking()` indicates that the returned entities should not be tracked by the Entity Framework context, optimizing performance for read-only scenarios. This functionality is part of the Conduit application's feature set that deals with articles, aiming to provide a rich data structure for front-end consumption.
